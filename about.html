        <h2>Where did this ceiling come from?</h2>
        <p>The ceiling comes from the second hall of a Buddhist temple in Beijing, <i>Temple of Wisdom Attained (Zhihuasi)</i>, which was built by the eunuch Wang Zhen in 1444.</p>
        
        <h2>What does it represent?</h2>
        <p>The ceiling, which would have been placed directly above Buddhist statuary, appears to represent a Buddhist heavenly realmâ€”the miniature temple halls around the sides contain Buddha figures and are supported on dense clouds.</p>
        
        <h2>Why does it look the way it does (decoration-wise)?</h2>
        <p>Coffered ceilings like this with elaborate and intricate carving were reserved for imperial palace halls and Buddhist altars. Ceiling decoration can vary depending on where it is installed. As this ceiling was made for an imperial-sponsored Buddhist hall, it is appropriate to have both imperial (dragon and phoenix) and Buddhist (lotus and heavenly beings) imagery. The use of the five-clawed dragon also signals imperial funding and patronage</p>
        
        <h2>What did it use to look like (gilded)?</h2>
        <p>The ceiling is made from nanmu, a type of hardwood traditionally used in Chinese architecture. After carving, the wood was then lacquered and gilded so it was originally bright and shiny. The gilding has worn off during the years, so what we are seeing now is mainly wood covered in a brownish-red lacquer.</p>
        
        <h2>Why did we decide to produce this interactive (what problem are we solving)?</h2>
        <p>There are many intricate and interesting details in the ceiling which are not readily visible from the ground. Lighting the ceiling is also challenging and while it may highlight details, it does not make them clearer. By capturing high-resolution images from both below and on a rotating platform, this interactive allows you experience the ceiling up-close.</p>
